36856210,"         INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY         Summary     Dedicated  Information Assurance Professional  well-versed in analyzing and mitigating risk and finding cost-effective solutions. Excels at boosting performance and productivity by establishing realistic goals and enforcing deadlines.  Versatile IT professional with 37 years of Enterprise design and engineering methodology.       Skills          Enterprise platforms  Knowledge of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)  Project tracking  Hardware and software upgrade planning  Product requirements documentation  Self-directed  MS Visio  Decisive  Collaborative  Domain Active Directory Layout  Data storage engineering      Information Assurance  Risk Management Framework (RMF)  Active Directory design and deployment  Workstation build and deployment  Systems Accreditation Packages  Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation and hardening  Network Design & Troubleshooting   High Performance Computing            Experience      Company Name    City  ,   State    Information Technology   02/2011   to   Current        I was hired to manage accreditation
efforts for a major department modernization project involving 3
accreditation packages each leading to successful Authorization To
Operate decisions.  Responsibilities then increased to include all
departmental accreditation efforts leading to another 3 successful
ATOs.  Now, working on 4 new accreditation including
re-authorization for an existing project.  Succeeded in writing and
implementing vulnerability management for existing accredited
systems.





Success
of the accreditation hinged on coordination with ONI Enterprise in
critical design decisions and to help the program integrate smoothly
into the Enterprise thru many meetings, analyzing the Enterprise
business model to understand the best fit for the program.





The
different projects required careful management of specific STIG
compliance and hardening for the different configurations and
services required for the specific domain to be integrated.   Analyzed complex computer systems to assess vulnerability and risk.    Supervised  5  external computer consultants and vendors.    Managed application patches, data backup, security changes and network configuration.           Company Name    City  ,   State    Systems Engineer   02/2006   to   02/2011        I was Hired
to initiate processing strategies in fulfilling department analyst requirements.  Requirements were fulfilled thru i dentifying product problems and strengths and collected data on customer experience  and review of Enterprise compliance to transition to new
technology for supporting new processing needs thru proper processing
power.  The next challenge  came as storage requirements for better performance and more
controlled uses.  After careful study of local infrastructure design, a local storage with off the shelf solutions was
adopted to grow local storage to over 200TB.  In using this solution,
the department saved just over a million dollars in purchasing and
maintenance costs compared to the alternative. Next came requirements to improve processing of future big data formats fulfilled in a Red Hat Linux high compute cluster I designed, purchased and
accredited for operation in the Enterprise.  Improvement on big data analytical processing reduced time from
30 hours to 30 minutes as well as allow for more robust data thru
higher selections of sensors, frequencies and range than allowed thru
the traditional process.         Company Name    City  ,   State    Senior Systems Analyst   02/1999   to   02/2006        I was hired to improve corporate and
client communications and processing requirements which resulted in
the design, build and deployment of 3 Enterprise network solutions.  One
solution resulted in expanding capabilities to supporting Washington
Navy Yard, Norfolk Virginia and Hawaii support facilities. 






Fulfilled
requirements for detecting crucial network software/hardware
weaknesses and developing preventive strategies and solutions for
avoiding interruptions and increasing system security thru
documenting system layouts, wiring diagrams and addressing schema to
understand layouts and make informed solutions to upper management.

I worked with teammates from the Procure to Pay, Orders to Cash, and Budget to Report areas to resolve daily challenges encountered with the deployment of DEAMS to additional customers and when system change requests were promoted to production.  I supported the testing of scripts, patches, and system change requests ensuring any anomalies were identified to the DEAMS Functional Management Office for action by the DEAMS Program Management Office and/or the System Integrator.  In addition, I served on a tiger team designed to identify and resolve General Ledger posting differences and supported the development of $360B in accounting adjustments allowing for the first successful fiscal year-end close in 2012.  These actions also allowed for the reconciliation and closure of fiscal year 2010 and 2011 accounting adjustments ensuring that all DEAMS fiscal year-end requirements were completed.  These actions were recognized as critical to the successful review report issued by the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) resulting in the Air Force receiving the authority to continue with the deployment of DEAMS.

I consistently managed three separate timelines for providing budget/unfunded requirements, providing documentation and various reports in the required format for each organization.

I supported the USAFE/FMA Financial metrics program by collaborating with DFAS Limestone in the development of an automated tool that provided senior leaders with visibility to any USAFE unit that is not in compliance with the established rules and regulations related to the GPC.  This tool provides management reports that are used to populate the monthly metric charts which are briefed by the USAFE/FMA.  This tool provided the capability for USAFE/FMA to collaborate with USAFE Contracting and develop/deploy joint guidance that supports the established Air Force Instruction mandating card suspension for card holders who are not in compliance with required reservation of funds in the entitlement system in support of the GPC.  I identified and resolved a problem with five GPC accounts that had been rejecting during the automated interface process each month.  My research revealed that these accounts were rejecting for invalid paying station and required manual intervention by both Wing and DFAS personnel.  This not only created rework, it delayed the payment of the invoices.  I partnered with DFAS Denver, corrected the records in the Access On-Line accounts eliminating the error condition.  I identified a method to deliver one-on-one training in support of the USAFE deployment of the Open Document Analysis (ODA) tool in FMSuite.  By utilizing Defense Connect Online I  provided training remotely, virtually eliminating the need to expend funds on Temporary Duty (TDY) travel.  The results of this training produced results that went well above expectations and were noted by the ODA Program Management Office.

I was responsible for the completeness and accuracy of weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual reports.  My branch monitored errors in the General Accounting and Finance System (GAFS/BQ) and ensured corrective actions were accomplished.  I also ensured fund balances were reconciled and reports were verified prior to release to base activities and higher headquarters.  Limestone reorganized under the High Performing Organization (HPO) in January 2007 and at that time I was reassigned to AM&C, a Directorate which previously did not exist.  My challenge during that time was to staff my branch, implement an aggressive training schedule, and ensure the continuity of financial reporting was maintained.  As we transitioned into the HPO we continued defining the missions and functions for AM&C for the entire network.  I participated in biweekly conference calls with Standards and Compliance in an effort to define missions and functions for AM&C.  Worked with management in determining FTEs needed for the branch.  I was responsible for developing meaningful performance standards for my employees since this branch and its functions did not previously exist.  Limestone POC for an initiative to eliminate suspense accounts throughout the agency.  Identified suspense accounts not initially targeted, formulated strategies to eliminate accounts or requested waivers, and participated in plans to modify processes using suspense accounts, such as the interfund suspense account.  These actions provided initial progress towards meeting the Department of Treasury's mandate to discontinue suspense accounts by February 2009.  Worked with staff to reduce reconciliations from $6.9 million in February 2007 to $1.1 million in August, accomplished this despite loss in experienced personnel and realigning resources to support critical initiatives in Accounts Payable.  I orchestrated the transition of reporting requirements for the Transportation Financial Management System (TFMS) workload from DFAS Omaha to Limestone.  After transition to Limestone encouraged staff responsible for these reports to streamline the processes.

My four first line supervisors were responsible for establishing priorities, schedules, and work assignments ensuring changes in workload are accounted for to minimize the impact on normal office operations.  We consistently reviewed these areas and made necessary personnel moves based on shifting priorities.  This was  extremely important during the DFAS Denver directed database consolidations and with the assumption of the Air National Guard workload.  Workload increased rapidly while staffing increased gradually, which dictated frequent priority changes and personnel moves.  I also worked closely with the Major Commands supported by DFAS Limestone strengthening our partnership when workload spikes negatively impacted our customers.  In December 2004, our overaged invoice percentage was nearing 25% and we had a backlog of vendor pay documents exceeding 30,000.  By working with the DFAS Command Client Executives and the Major Command Comptrollers, I was instrumental in forming a strategy that included soliciting Air Force personnel assistance in document processing, identification of ""must pay now"" bills, and the formation of special action response teams dedicated to responding to our customer's most urgent requirements.  As a result of these efforts, in a three month period, we were able to reduce our overaged invoice percentage by 19% and our backlog of documents to no documents over 20 days old thereby minimizing the adverse impact on customer funds.

Utilizing my expertise with Louis II data retrieval software, I produced ad-hoc data queries for in-house and external use by our customers.  These retrievals were designed to reduce the man- hours necessary to perform complex finance and accounting functions by DFAS and Air Force personnel.  I was responsible for the budget resources necessary to operate the branch.  In this capacity, I prepared budget over execution justifications, plan and monitor overtime costs, and control supply purchases to ensure the most cost efficient operation possible.  I was required to respond to inquiries from various sources, which include, but are not limited to, vendors, DFAS management, accounting liaison offices, resource advisors, and other DFAS field sites.

Company Name    City      Aerospace Engineer   01/2014   to   01/2015       Member of the AIAA and the front line team that developed a novel cooling design system for turbine blades.  Throughout this process, computational fluid dynamic software (STARCCM) and CAD were highly implemented to simulate different geometries inside a wind tunnel.  Pressures, temperatures, velocities among other important physical quantities were analyzed in 40 different geometries.  This project contributed with the optimization process of turbine blades and aided them to achieve higher temperature levels and efficiency.  It is not a secret in today's industry that turbine engines are able to produce extremely high inlet temperatures when they implement cooling impingement, which allow them to cool down the system without harming the performance of the engine.

Programming Arts at DSU, I have drastically improved the bottom line of
shows at the Cox Performing Arts Center and the Tanner Amphitheater and have simultaneously created and funded
permanent improvements and endowments. The Trailblazer Summer Concert Series at
the Tanner went from consistently losing money to net profit in both 2015 and
2016.

By changing the way tickets are
marketed, I was able to generate a 30% increase in season ticket memberships to the Celebrity Concert Series in only one year. I have also created a scholarship
program for College of the Arts students at DSU which financially supported
twelve students in 2016. I sought and obtained donations from the community in
order to completely renovate the Cox Center's Green room and made permanent
improvements to the aesthetics of the stage at Tanner Amphitheater including
adding shade to the performing area as well as new lighting and sound
equipment. All of this was completed without receiving any additional funding from the University.      Experience     03/2014   to   Current     Director of Programming Arts    Company Name   －   City  ,   State    As the Director of Programming Arts
at Dixie State University, I am responsible for the cultural arts activities at
multiple venues. The Cox Performing Arts Center (1200 seats) is the home of the Celebrity
Concert Series (CCS) which has been the premier performing arts series in
the area since 1958. I am responsible for the management of the CCS and
my duties include overseeing all programming, marketing, hospitality, financial accounts, administration, and
fulfillment. I am also responsible for interacting with and guiding the
CCS Board of Directors comprised of community leaders and performing arts
enthusiasts. The CCS plays host to a wide variety of entertainment genres.
Our current season includes Manhattan Transfer with Take 6, the Utah Symphony,
The Drifters, GENTRI, and Canadian Brass to name a few.

I am also responsible, during the
summer months, for all facets of programming and management of the Tanner
Amphitheater (1600 seats) in Springdale, Utah at the entrance to Zion National Park. Before
I came to DSU, this outdoor theater was used for a handful of local artists
playing weekend shows on a bare stage. I have completely rethought this venue
by adding visual design elements, incorporating concessions and catering,
seeking and obtaining permits to serve alcohol, and structuring the programming
around two series formats. The first series is comprised of festival-style events where each
performance date is focused on a specific genre of music and marketed as a
standalone event with multiple artists hired for each show. The results have been miraculous as we turned a poorly attended series into an important,
well-attended festival that was supported both by the community and the
tourists staying in Springdale as part of their vacation to Zion National
Park. 

The second series is an original
show called, ""Sanctuary: The Story of Zion"" which was written to
correspond with the centennial celebration of our National Parks. I co-created,
produced, and directed the show as well as assembled and hired the performance
and tech team. This show was based on feedback we received from the area
business owners when asked what kind of entertainment would best be supported by
the tourists who come to the area. Sanctuary tells the story of Zion National
Park though storytelling, music, and the unique usage of video projection to
share testimonials of many prominent Zion Park officials as well as world-class
artists and climbers who call Zion home.       01/2010   to   Current     Board of Directors Member    Company Name   －   City  ,   State    SUSWA continues to be a creative force in the Southern

creating production music that has been featured on such networks as Discovery,
Disney, A&E, and many others, I managed each of these activities along with
a talented staff of creative minded engineers and musicians. 

Spiral Studios has also been
involved with many festival-style shows by hiring and managing artists and providing A/V equipment.  In my time at Spiral Studios, I was able
to create many industry relationships with both entertainers and
management.  These relationships have
allowed for a deep understanding of performing arts from the perspective of an
entertainer as well as a director.  This
knowledge informs my decisions and gives me a unique perspective in my role as Director of
Programming.  I continue to own Spiral Studios but have turned day-to-day operations over to a studio manager and a staff of creative engineers.       01/1994   to   Current     Musician    Company Name   －     State    As a touring/performing musician, I have had the opportunity to travel the world.  This musical ability has been the backbone of my career as I have transitioned from performing to audio engineering to managing performing arts facilities and concert series.  This experience allows the unique position of a deep understanding of multiple sides of the industry.  As I communicate with touring musicians, I have an intimate knowledge of the challenges they face.  I completely understand the technical demands and needs of the events I manage.  Lastly, I have a firm grasp on marketing and management, which has been central to my 25  year career.

54100393,"         ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS TEACHER       Summary    I am passionate about teaching and caring for students holistically. I believe it is crucial for students to develop critical thinking skills as they develop their sense of self and their worldview. I prioritize teacher collaboration to develop a community among educators and to develop best practices. I pursue professional development opportunities to better serve all of my students with an emphasis on equity, differentiation and inquiry-based learning.

In my time at Lakes, I have taught 9th grade, 11th grade and 12th grade English as well as AP Literature and AP Language. Due to some teacher turnover and the adapting needs of the English department, I have had the opportunity to build my experience across grade levels and develop curriculum after curriculum to suit the needs of students at various ages. As a result, I believe one of my greatest strengths is my understanding of the skills necessary at each grade level for students to successfully exist high school career or college-ready.         06/2016   to   06/2017     Head Of English Department    Company Name   －   City  ,   State    For the past two years I have served as the English Department Head. This position required planning and scheduling of monthly departmental meetings, allocation of department funds, participation in the District Literacy Committee and disseminating information from administration to English teachers, and vice versa. To better serve the English department, I initiated monthly meetings with our Principal, Mrs. Mauer-Smith, to plan department meetings. Additionally, teachers were invited monthly to contribute agenda items or areas of professional development interest to inform these meetings and make them as meaningful as possible.       07/2016   to   06/2017     ASB Advisor    Company Name   －   City  ,   State    I was very excited to accept the position as the ASB Advisor at Lakes High School. In our Leadership Program, I highly prioritized student-leadership and facilitation. It was a regular practice that I met with our Senior ASB officers to discuss Leadership Development content and project management that they would facilitate in future classes. I saw my role as advisor to highlight student abilities, passions and ideas to build beautiful products while teacher students the value of understanding the process by which products come to be. All year, we emphasized the pillars of Knowledge, Courage and Compassion to serve our student body and develop personally as Knowledgeable, Courageous and Compassionate people.

Together, the GATE identified students and I, created a school newspaper. We named it the Jr Journal and invented five topics that would be in every issue. I helped create an outline and template that our reporters could follow and eventually do independently. Each student chose a different topic every month and would either interview or research to write an article for that section. They would then write a rough draft, that I would edit, and then they would type the final draft and put it into the newspaper template. Students would also have a chance to find graphics or take pictures that fit their topic. It turned out great and we were able to publish four issues. This will be our second year. This was a great accomplishment for me as an educator, because I love to write and was in my school newspaper in High School. I had the chance to share a passion of mine and see students enjoy coming in after school and put their advanced brains to work. It was such a great experience and can't wait to have that again this year.    ",TEACHER
