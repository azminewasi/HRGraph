APPLICATION DEADLINE:  17 August 2010
ABOUT COMPANY:  ADB is an international development finance institution
whose mission is to help its developing member countries reduce poverty
and improve the quality of life of their people. Headquartered in Manila,
and established in 1966, ADB is owned and financed by its 67 members, of
which 48 are from the region and 19 are from other parts of the globe.
ADB's main partners are governments, the private sector, nongovernment
organizations, development agencies, community-based organizations, and
foundations.
In pursuing its vision, ADB's main instruments comprise loans, etc. 
Although most lending is in the public sector - and to governments - ADB
also provides direct assistance to private enterprises of developing
countries through equity investments, guarantees and loans.
ABOUT:  Armenia has an impressive record in the World Bank's Doing
Business rankings, moving from a global rank of 50 in 2009 to 43 in 2010
in terms of ease of doing business. It wants to improve the quality as
well as the speed of business registration to further attract
investments. ADB has approved a capacity development technical assistance
(TA) to help Armenia strengthen the State Registry Agency (SRA) in
providing better services and increasing access to information on
Armenian businesses. Armenia recognizes the importance of good financial
governance standards in improving its investment climate. Post-crisis, it
will be even more important to restore investments, including foreign
direct investment. From 2000 to 2008, Armenias net foreign direct
investment was in the range of 7%8% of gross domestic product, but it is
forecast to decline to less than 5% in 20092010. Increasing private
sector participation and investments requires information on business
opportunities. Sustaining private sector development is high on the
government's reform agenda and is the main driver for sustained growth
under the second poverty reduction strategy paper (20082021). 
Accordingly, the Government of Armenia is pursuing an ambitious plan
towards becoming a center of excellence in governance generally, and in
improving the business environment and reducing the cost of doing
business in particular. An action plan to this effect has been issued by
the Prime Minister. A major segment of this reform deals with increasing
efficiency and simplifying the procedures in the State Registry Agency
(SRA) through two initiatives: (i) full automation, so that the current
system of manual registration is computerized; and (ii) establishing a
one-window operation to facilitate business start-up. In addition to the
time spent in the SRA and organizing facilities such as utility
connections, businesses apply for getting titles cleared from the Patents
Offices and separately file to get tax numbers from the State Tax
Service. The action plan envisages setting up 10 ""business facilitation
centers"" to handle all the tasks under one roof in coordination with the
relevant agencies. It needs to be assessed if they would need to be new
entities, upgraded regional offices of the SRA, or outsourced operations.
The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) and the SRA have prepared a program for
simplification of the functions and processes of the SRA. The proposed TA
is in response to the government's request for support to establish an
online business registry as part of this program.
The objective is to assist the State Registry Agency (SRA) in providing
businesses with a hassle free registration process through the
computerization of its business registration.
